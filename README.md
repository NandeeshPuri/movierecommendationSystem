## Features
- User input for preferences (genre, ratings, etc.)
- Personalized movie recommendations
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Visualization of recommendations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (or any other libraries you used)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model training:
jupyter notebook
Launch the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the application.

4. How It Works
   
The system uses collaborative filtering/content-based filtering (or any other algorithm you implemented) to generate recommendations.
User preferences are collected through an input form, and the model returns a list of recommended movies based on the input criteria.
